step-by-step:

client-side (create folder client)
1. install react.js vite and tailwind css (template)

2. create pages and routes: 
	install react router dom package: create routes inside application
	create folder pages and create files

3. create header section
	create component folder
	have 3 section in header (logo, search, menu)
	install react icons package
	very easy to adjust responsiveness in tailwind (set mobile first, then after mobile do this)
	import link to bring user from one to another page without refreshing the page


server-side (create folder api)
4. create and run the server
	initialize a package json, in the root of project, not in the api folder
	create file index.js
	install express
	install nodemon (for auto refresh application everytime i save the file)
